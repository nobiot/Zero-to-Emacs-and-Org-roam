# Notes on Org-roam V2

As of 17 Jul 2021, V2 has been released. Both MELPA and MELPA-Stable have this version of Org-roam. It will be markedly different from v1 for both its initial setup and daily usage. At the moment, most of the content of guide will only be applicable to v1 for Org-roam and its related packages such as Org-roam-bibtex.

I am gradually revising this guide in its entirety for v2. I am hoping that I can do this during the Nothern Hemisphere's summer.

The the latest version of this guide compatible for v1 is available in the [v1 branch of this repositry](https://github.com/nobiot/Zero-to-Emacs-and-Org-roam/tree/v1).

# Zero to Emacs and Org-roam: a step-by-step guide on Windows 10

I took the liberty of creating a step-by-step guide for people new to Emacs. I have written this with Windows users with no Linux or programming background in mind, zero about Emacs.

The guide aims to get you going real quick, starting with downloading Emacs with vanilla configuration (no Doom, no Spacemacs).

I won't repeat why you might like to use Emacs or plain text to write. Here is what I think is the best response to the question: ["The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science"](https://plain-text.co/) by Kieran Healy of Duke University.

At the end of step-by-step guide of Part 1, your Emacs will look like this.

## Audience and purpose in mind

The audience I have had in mind are:

- New to Emacs
- Windows users (Emacs part should be useful for others, I hope)
- No programming or Linux background
- Looking to use Org-roam / Emacs to help write long-form material (essays / papers about life, humanities, or some qualitative social sciences, etc.) as opposed to math and programming

Even if you are already down the path of using a framework like Doom, I hope stepping back a little and actually finishing configuration from scratch will help you understand how things fit together – it’s a bit like DIY making stuff; completing one thing from start to finish seems to help you leap to the next level of understanding and confidence for some reason.

## Part 1

1. Get Emacs for Windows
2. Use Emacs to write some text (including copy & paste)
3. Set up Org-roam (including sqlite3)
4. Improve quality-of-life with your font, theme, and minimal select packages

## Part 2
5. (maybe) How to swap CapsLock with Ctrl
6. Set up Org-roam-ui for a graph visualization of your notes
7. Set up Org-ref and Org-roam-bibtex (ORB)
8. Export to MS Word
9. Set up a spell checker (Hunspell, including how to get it)

## Part 3
10. Work with PDF files in Emacs with PDF-Tools, Org-noter, and ORB
11. Insert an image from the clipboard, or the Snipping Tool on Windows (incl. in-line display resizing without Imagemagick, or external programs)
