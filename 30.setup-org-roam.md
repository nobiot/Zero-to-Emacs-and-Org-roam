You could update the package repository as instructed in the documentaion; you can do it but you don't have to.

## Install Org-roam in Emacs

```
;; Packages
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)

(setq package-check-signature nil)
```

It is important to set this:

    (setq package-check-signature nil)

Otherwise, you will get an error message after running `package-list-packges`

    error in process filter: package--check-signature-content: Failed to verify signature: "archive-contents.sig"
    
Wait for a while (possibly 30 seconds or so) until you see "Package refresh done" message in minibuffer.
